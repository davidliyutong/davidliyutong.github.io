<font size=5> <b>Master Graduate in Information Engineering</b> <br> Shanghai Jiao Tong University</font>
<br>

I am currently working at [RobotFlow](https://github.com/robotflow-initiative) lab. My MS was completed at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University under
the supervision of [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/) and guidance of [Dr. Wenqiang Xu](https://wenqiangx.github.io/).

## Research Interests

I am committed to implementing robots that assist in human labor and life and thus expert in building complex software-hardware combined robotic systems. My main research interests are:

- **Sensor Systems**: I developped an [MarkIt](https://sites.google.com/view/markit-virat/home) during Master. Our work [Capturing forceful interaction with deformable objects using a deep learning-powered stretchable tactile array](https://github.com/jeffsonyu/ViTaM) (accepted by **Nature Communication**) proposed a tactile glove with pressure sensing. Currently, I am building a modular wireless IMU-based motion capture glove.
- **Robot Learning**: I learned about all aspects of robotics learning while developping the bi-hand garment manipulation system [UniFolding: Towards Sample-efficient, Scalable, and Generalizable Robotic Garment Folding](https://unifolding.robotflow.ai/) (presented at **CoRL2023**).

Also, I have a deep interest in these areas：

- **Computer Vision**: Not only do I have extensive knowledge of traditional image and video processing algorithms, but I am also very familiar with 3D vision algorithms, multi-angle point cloud reconstruction depth cameras.
- **Simulation**: I have experience with simulators such as PyBullet、Issaclab and contributes to [pyrfuniverse](https://github.com/robotflow-initiative/pyrfuniverse).
- **HPC & Networking**: I am interested in building intelligent data centers and server clusters, having been involved in [Towards an energy-efficient Data Center Network based on deep reinforcement learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128622001220).

## Strengths

I completed my undergraduate and graduate studies at SJTU ParisTech Elite Institute, a Sino-French cooperative program that features a solid and rich **engineering** curriculum. Here are some of my skills:

**Programming**. I specialize in multiple programming languages, including:

- Expert Level: **C/C++**, **Python** and **Golang**.
- Advanced Level: **Shell**, **CMake**, **Makefile**, **MATLAB**, **Shell** and **Dockerifle**.
- Intermediate Level: **JavaScript** and **CUDA**.
- Beginner: **Verilog**.

**Embedded Development**. I have ample experience in the field of embedded development.

- **Platforms**: **FreeRTOS** (ESP32, STM32, Arduino) and **Linux** (RK Series, Raspberry Pis).
- **Peripherals**: SPI, I2C, UART, PWM/ADC, I2C and BNO IMUs.
- **Communication**: BLE, WLAN, 802.15.4, Ethernet and 6LoWPAN.
