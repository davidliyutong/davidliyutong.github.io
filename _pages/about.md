I am currently working at [RobotFlow](https://github.com/robotflow-initiative) lab. My MS was completed at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University under
the supervision of [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/) and guidance of [Dr. Wenqiang Xu](https://wenqiangx.github.io/). I am committed to implementing robots that assist
in human labor and life and thus expert in building complex software-hardware combined robotic systems. My main
research interests are sensor systems and robot learning, I am also familiar with **computer vision** and **simulation**.

I am proficient in embedded development, familiar with programming languages such as **C**, **C++**, **Golang** and **Python**. I am good at developing various embedded intelligent hardware that integrates communication, control, and perception using ESP32, STM32, and Arduino. I am familiar with commonly used peripherals such as **PWM/ADC**. In addition to inertial sensors such as the **MPU/BNO** series, I also familiar with sensor modules such as pressure sensors. In the field of communication engineering, I am familiar with communication protocols such as **UART**, **SPI**, **I2C**, **ModBus**, **WLAN**, **802.15.4**, **6LoWPAN**, **BLE** and **Ethernet**. In addition, I also have a good understanding of **TCP** and **UDP**, as well as application layer protocols such as **HTTP**, **gRPC**, **WebSocket**, **MQTT** and **CoAP**. Basically, I use **FreeRTOS** extensively in my projects and have a deep understanding of it. I have touched various **Linux** development boards represented by Raspberry Pi, and have carried out development projects such as cameras driver, computer vision, video encoding (with FFMpeg), and time-sensitive network on the Linux platform.

In addition, I have experience in developing packages related to **ROS1**/**ROS2** systems, as well as secondary development experience with the **OptiTrack** optical tracking system. In the field of distributed sensors, I have extensive experience in sensor time synchronization, data collection, recording, and storage.

In the field of simulation and analysis, I participated in the development of the [RFUniverse](https://github.com/robotflow-initiative/rfuniverse) simulation environment and have a deeper understanding of its architecture. Additionally, I have a certain understanding of simulation algorithms such as **MPM** and **IPC**. I can complete robot simulations using open-source environments like **PyBullet**, and visualize results using tools like **Open3D** and **ImGui**.

I have used multiple robot systems, including **Franka Panda**, **Flexiv Rizon**, and the **UR** series, and have a certain understanding of their characteristics. I have also encountered motion planning algorithm libraries like OMPL and collision detection systems based on bullet. I am capable of designing **3D printed grippers** to assist the robot in performing better, or designing camera mounts to secure the camera more effectively.

I am also skilled in the planning, construction, and maintenance of distributed computer systems. I am very familiar with** Debian/RedHat** and their derivative distributions, and have participated in projects based on Windows Server. In terms of virtualization in distributed systems, I am familiar with virtualization technologies represented by **KVM** and **OpenVZ**, and have conducted virtualization experiments based on **Qemu**. I have also deployed commercial and open-source virtualization platforms such as HyperV and Proxmox, particularly familiar with the Proxmox virtualization platform. In terms of storage systems, I not only have a lot of application experience with **CIFS/NFS** but have also deployed **object storage** (based on MinIO), **ISCSI** (based on TrueNAS and ZFS), and other storage systems. I have deployed **Ceph** distributed file system and **GlusterFS** distributed file system to provide storage services for the laboratory's distributed machine learning applications.In the field of cloud computing, I am very familiar with the **Kubernetes** system architecture, have a lot of experience in building, maintaining, and upgrading K8S clusters, and have carried out distributed deep learning applications based on the Kubernetes system. I am proficient in the construction and maintenance of Docker images and can write robust cloud-native software using the most modern development process. In terms of software-defined networks, I am not only familiar with and have practiced key SDN technologies such as **BGP**, **OSPF**, **VXLAN**, **Wireguard**, but also have researched and practiced Zero Trust Network Access (**ZTNA**). In parallel computing, I can use **MPI**, **Hadoop**, **DeepSpeed**, and other parallel computing frameworks to complete scientific computing, big data processing, and deep learning tasks. In terms of IT operations, I can correctly configure and maintain various IT facilities, including general **servers**, **workstations**, **switches**, **storage**, **routers**, **firewalls**, **VPNs**, **access points**, **monitoring and alarm systems**, and **identity authentication systems**. I also write frontend tools with javascript when neccesary.
