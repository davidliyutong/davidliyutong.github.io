<font size=5> `<b>`Master Graduate in Information Engineering`</b>` `<br>` Shanghai Jiao Tong University`</font>`
`<br>`

I am currently working at [RobotFlow](https://github.com/robotflow-initiative) lab. My MS was completed at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University under
the supervision of [Prof. Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/) and guidance of [Dr. Wenqiang Xu](https://wenqiangx.github.io/).

Starting August 2025, I will be a PhD student at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), starting from August 2025.

## Research Interests

I am committed to building complex robotic systems with integrated hardware and software to help humans work and live better. My main research interests are:

- **Sensor Systems**: I developped a [MarkIt](https://sites.google.com/view/markit-virat/home) when I was taking my Master's. In [Capturing forceful interaction with deformable objects using a deep learning-powered stretchable tactile array](https://github.com/jeffsonyu/ViTaM), a paper accepted by **Nature Communication**, we proposed a tactile glove with pressure sensing. Currently, I am building a modular wireless IMU-based motion capture glove.
- **Robot Learning**: I learned about all aspects of robotics learning while developping the bi-hand garment manipulation system [UniFolding: Towards Sample-efficient, Scalable, and Generalizable Robotic Garment Folding](https://unifolding.robotflow.ai/) (presented at **CoRL2023**).

Also, I have a deep interest in the following areasï¼š

- **Computer Vision**: Not only do I have extensive knowledge of traditional image and video processing algorithms, but I am also very familiar with 3D vision algorithms, multi-angle point cloud reconstruction depth cameras.
- **Simulation**: I have experience with simulators such as PyBullet, Issaclab and have contributed to [pyrfuniverse](https://github.com/robotflow-initiative/pyrfuniverse).
- **HPC & Networking**: I am interested in building intelligent data centers and server clusters, having been involved in [Towards an energy-efficient Data Center Network based on deep reinforcement learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128622001220).

## Strengths
