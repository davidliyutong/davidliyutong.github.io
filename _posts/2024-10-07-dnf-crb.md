EPEL, known as Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux, is a project maintained by the Fedora community to provide additional high-quality packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and its derivatives, such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, and others. These packages are often applications and tools that are not included in the official RHEL repositories, but are useful to many users and developers.

Configuration Methods:

```shell
dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
dnf install epel-release
```
